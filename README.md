# TC/L interaction probability model
Python script to compute probability of interaction with taurocholate/lecithin based on two descriptors, logD and CrippenMR.
The model is based on results from Mol. Pharmaceutics 2022, 19, 2868âˆ’2876 (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.2c00227), but descriptors are computed via rdkit/scopy instead of MOE/PaDEL.

Lipid interaction probability model (model3.py) is currently work in progress.

Alternatively, enamine_db.html and zinc_db.html contain calculated TC/L and lipid probabilities with the original models 2 and 3 from the publication, using MOE/PaDEL descriptors.
